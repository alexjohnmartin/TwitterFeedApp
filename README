Overview
Write a web application that gathers data from some twitter feeds, merges the feeds to a list, provides
some simple aggregates, and then returns a response.

Implementation
1. Connect to the Twitter API (you will need a dev account for this)
2. Get a list of all tweets from the last two weeks for the following three twitter accounts: 
@pay_by_phone @PayByPhone @PayByPhone_UK
3. Return the list in a json formatted response: sorted by time, with item data: twitter account, tweet,
tweet date and time
4. Provide the following aggregate information in the response as well:
a. Total number of tweets per account for the two week period

b. Total number of times another user was mentioned in tweets, per account for the two week period
Requirements
You are free to use any development environment, tools, and resources that you see fit. Your solution should, however, fulfill the following requirements:
• Use C# and the .NET framework (which version is up to you)
• Create a web application, using an MVC or REST framework
• Provide a UAT test that exercises the result, as well as the original source code for both
• Focus on SOLID, unit tests, and code organization
